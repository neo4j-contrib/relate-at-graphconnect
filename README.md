[Relate! at Graph Connect](http://neo4j-contrib.github.com/relate-at-graphconnect)
========================
the un-conference of related nodes

Like trading the strict schema of relational tables for the organic organization of a graph, 
the Relate! [un-conference](http://www.unconference.net) will guide community-driven participatory 
events during Graph Connect. We'll provide demo space, organize hacking sessions, and host social 
discussions as you establish your own connections with other graphistas.
